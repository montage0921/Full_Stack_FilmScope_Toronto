TIFF Next Wave Presents: Kuessipan,"[['Wednesday, November 20 ', '6:30 pm', 'https://am.ticketmaster.com/tiff/ism/NE4yMDYzVDQ=']]",Kuessipan ,,Myriam Verreault,"Canada,2019,117m,French; Innu","Adapted from Naomi Fontaine’s acclaimed novel,   is Myriam Verreault’s first narrative feature. In a Quebec Innu community, Mikuan (Sharon Fontaine-Ishpatao) and Shaniss (Yamie Grégoire) struggle to maintain their close friendship when they clash over their diverging ambitions. When Mikuan falls in love with a white boy and starts to consider a life beyond their tiny reserve, her bond with Shaniss and her family is put to the test. A coming-of-age story told with humour, tenderness, and heartbreak,   is a poignant exploration of evolving friendship and dreams, and the bonds that will forever root us in our culture.   is told through an Indigenous lens, yet remains relevant to us all as we discover the power of community — along with the individual strength it takes to follow our own path.

All About My Mother with Lina Rodríguez,"[['Friday, November 1 ', '7:00 pm', 'https://am.ticketmaster.com/tiff/buy/ism/NE4wMTcwVDE=']]",All About My Mother,Todo sobre mi madre,Pedro Almodóvar,"Spain,1999,101m,Spanish","Shedding the high-concept plots (if not the high-concept characters) of his films from the previous decade, with  , Almodóvar set out to make a film in the same vein as the director he had long proclaimed his idol — Douglas Sirk — and took home his first Academy Award for Best International Feature in the bargain. When her teenage son Esteban is killed in a car crash, grieving middle-aged nurse Manuela (Cecilia Roth) heads to Barcelona in search of the boy’s father, whom Esteban had never met. While searching the city for her former lover, Manuela reluctantly becomes the hub of a makeshift matriarchal community that includes a pregnant nun (Penélope Cruz), a trans hustler (Antonia San Juan), and the glamorous actress (Marisa Paredes) her son idolized. Marrying the soberness and maturity of   with the heightened visuals of the director’s late-’80s work,   is “the achieved synthesis of the whole Almodóvariety show, a new genre — part farce, part weepie, low camp and high melodrama, caustic yet heartwarming, humanist and programmatically gender-blurring” (J. Hoberman,  )."

The blackest of black comedies,   stars Maura as Gloria, a beleaguered cleaning woman working 18-hour days fuelled by little more than Mother’s Little Helpers. Her life in a faceless apartment complex on the edges of Madrid is defined by her uninterested, chauvinist husband, her sex worker neighbour, and her two troubled sons (the eldest sells drugs, the younger is taken advantage of by his friends’ fathers) — and her plate only gets fuller when an impotent policeman, a telekinetic child, and (a nod to Roald Dahl’s “Lamb to the Slaughter”) a rather large ham bone are added to the mix. “Carmen Maura is Mr. Almodóvar’s secret weapon: grave, put-upon, curious funny, Woman Outraged, she carries the whole picture” ( )."

On paper, she’s there to unfreeze her grandfather’s savings, which were stolen after he was exiled during the Nakba in 1948; however, the reality she encounters — a combination of Kafkaesque bureaucracy, deeply entrenched discrimination, and moments of stunning beauty — leads her to not only learn about her past, but also the vast possibilities for the future. Jacir plunges the viewer into the world of Palestinians, capturing the frustrations and indignities of life under occupation and how life and dreams, in spite of the odds, continue to flourish."

Before she can follow through, she is interrupted by a series of distractions — including a yuppie couple looking to rent her penthouse apartment (Antonio Banderas and Rossy de Palma), the police, a mambo-obsessed taxi driver, a feminist lawyer, and Shiite terrorists — that set her on a path from death-wishing vulnerability to strong, self-assured independence. A pivotal film in Almodóvar’s career,   was the director’s first true international hit, his first film to be nominated for an Academy Award, and — thanks to a scaling-back of the shock value his previous works had enthusiastically traded in — the film that began his transition from fringe-y provocateur to acclaimed art-house auteur. “A perfectly realized work by a man of demonic wit and tender sensibility” ( )."

Reportedly rejected by Cannes for “sacrilegious content,” the most straightforward comedy in Almodóvar’s oeuvre finds the director not-so-subtly attacking the continued influence of the Catholic Church on everyday life in Spain.

Not surprisingly, as the first feature film directed by a Black woman to receive a theatrical release in the US,   continues to make film history, inspiring the work of contemporary artists — perhaps most famously providing inspiration for Beyonce’s 2016 visual album,  .

But this is no spectacular homecoming. He’s back somewhat begrudgingly to honour his “wajib” (or duty) to hand out invitations to his sister’s wedding alongside his father, Abu Shadi (played by Saleh Bakri’s real-life father, actor-director Mohammad Bakri). The simmering tension between the two — who are often stuck in a car, more often than not in traffic — builds, exposing the sometimes-comic chasms that exist between men who live in different worlds but share an unshakable bond. Since her award-winning debut,  , and in her TIFF-featured follow-up,  , writer-director Annemarie Jacir has explored the displacement of Palestinians. Now, for the first time, she looks at the experience of Palestinians living within Israel’s borders. With its humour rooted in observational moments — and in the Bakris’ uncanny ability to convey all-too-relatable familial exasperation — Wajib is a touching tale that examines the easily blurred line between love and duty."

They were defeated, and the Israeli army deployed into the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in these territories fled the military occupation to refugee camps in neighbouring Arab countries, joining the hundreds of thousands of refugees that had settled in camps more than two decades earlier in 1948. Free-spirited 11-year-old Tarek (Mahmoud Asfa) and his mother Ghaydaa (Ruba Blal) have temporarily settled in the Harir camp in Jordan, but in the chaos they have been separated from Tarek’s father Ghassan. Restless and uneasy, Tarek has trouble adjusting to the indignity of destitution and living on humanitarian aid. Only a few miles away from the Harir camp, in the clandestine encampments that border Israel, the atmosphere is radically different, as armed Palestinian freedom fighters are training for battle to reverse the course of historic injustice and reclaim their lands and homes. When Tarek and his mother cross paths with this group of combatants, the boy is emboldened and chooses to stay with them, forcing his mother to follow suit. Annemarie Jacir’s second feature is a worthy successor to her prize-winning debut  . Passionate but devoid of didacticism,   is a mature and quietly moving evocation of the very real barriers — walls, fences, checkpoints — surrounding the Arab diaspora, and the life-affirming spirit of those who struggle to break free of them. In Tarek and Ghadyaa’s inspiring, emancipating journey, Jacir has realized the secretly recalcitrant reverie that every Palestinian refugee has dreamed countless times."

As an outlet, Leo takes up another pseudonym to critique her own work for a local paper, whose editor Ángel (Juan Echanove) is a hopeless romantic and devout fan of Amanda Gris’ work. Given the decisive shift in Almodóvar’s filmmaking soon thereafter, it is all too tempting to read   as veiled autobiography, especially as certain of its plot elements seeded some of the director’s key “serious” works (notably the organ donation that sparks   and the man-in-the-freezer at the centre of  )."

This roughness, however, was celebrated by Spanish critics who viewed it as a riposte to the rigidity of the Franco era ― although the director himself joked, “When a film has one defect, people say it’s badly made; but when it has many, they say it has invented a new style.” When Pepi (soon-to-be Almodóvar regular Carmen Maura) is sexually assaulted by a policeman, she and her friend Bom (played by teenage punk-rock star Alaska) set out to corrupt the cop’s abused wife Luci (Eva Siva) by introducing her to the punk underground ― a lifestyle that Luci takes to with surprising gusto.

Combining taut storytelling, dynamic visual style, and career-best performances, this is a rewarding romance from a master in the making. Broke, unhoused, and drifting, Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) scrambles to make a living for himself and his young son as a back-alley boxer, while dreaming of making it big as a mixed martial artist. Taking work as a nightclub bouncer, he crosses paths with Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), who works as an orca trainer at an amusement park, commanding the creatures with an ease absent from her interpersonal relations. After Stéphanie suffers a terrible accident, the unlikely pair falls into a tender, tentative courtship. Physicality is at the core of the film, and Audiard captures visceral images with clear-eyed attentiveness. Echoing the film’s vivid contrast of brutality and tenderness, Alexandre Desplat’s powerful score is interspersed with a surprising selection of pop songs; Katy Perry’s “Fireworks” provides one of the film’s most moving and unexpected moments. An unconventional and deeply felt study of human frailty,   proves Audiard’s most assured cinematic turn, perhaps only second to his audacious, new pop-opera,  , France’s official Oscar submission, which screens at TIFF Lightbox this November.

The labyrinthine story begins in 1980, as a wannabe actor using the name Ángel (Gael García Bernal) approaches upstart director Enrique (Fele Martínez) to peddle a script called  , which relates the tale of two boys named Ignacio and Enrique who fall in love with each other while attending an all-boys Catholic school in 1964. Intertwining these two narratives and timeframes, Almodóvar then adds another focused on transgender avenger Zahara (also García Bernal), who in 1977 returns to the school threatening to blackmail the priest who had molested Ignacio. At the time of the film's release, it was considered controversial for the soft treatment of its more harmful characters — the sinning priest is portrayed as a man of great weakness rather than outright evil.   is a delirious tangle of narrative twists and turns, bending identities, shifting sympathies, and blurring metafiction."

His sister Tina (Carmen Maura) is a transgender single mother and struggling actor who, citing two failed affairs with two equally inappropriate partners — her father and her padre — has given up on men. Pablo, meanwhile, feeling neglected by the lover he adores, drifts through a series of one-night stands, leading him into the snare of Antonio (Antonio Banderas), a violent and possessive young fan. Seeking to prevent potential producer interference with his uncompromising story, Almodóvar established the production company El Deseo with his brother Agustín, and reaped the rewards when the film took off both critically and commercially. “It’s the key film in my life and career. It deals with my vision of desire — the absolute necessity of being desired, and the fact that in the interplay of desires it’s rare that two desires meet and correspond” (Almodóvar)."
Parallel Mothers with recorded intro by Maria Delgado,"[['Sunday, November 10 ', '7:00 pm', 'https://am.ticketmaster.com/tiff/ism/NE4xMDcwVDM=']]",Parallel Mothers,,Pedro Almodóvar,"Spain, France,2021,123m,Spanish","Almodóvar’s 2021 feature is arguably his most overtly political work to date — a work that grapples with the issue of Spain’s mass graves: more than 114,000 disappeared persons — civilians shot by Franco’s Rebel forces in extrajudicial executions during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. Penélope Cruz won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her performance as a photographer, Janis, looking to excavate the grave where her great-grandfather is thought to lie. Parallel narratives intersect as Janis realizes that her principles are compromised by the secrets she keeps from Ana, a young woman she meets in the hospital (newcomer Milena Smit) while giving birth to her baby daughter Cecilia. This is an important film that argues for a nation’s need to understand its history, however complex or difficult. A healthy dose of melodrama cuts across a drama that celebrates Spain’s culture — from the culinary to the theatrical — and recognises the importance of an ethical engagement with the past.   offers Cruz — in her eighth collaboration with Almodóvar — arguably one of her most complex roles to date. Director of Photography José Luis Alcaine shapes what Almodóvar terms “a very luminous photography for a sombre story”, and composer Alberto Iglesias — a collaborator since   — once more provides a sublime musical dialogue with the story.

Hinton novel reimagined as a surreal, righteously furious thriller. At the tender age of 15, Alia (Devery Jacobs) has taken over the drug-dealing business of her father Joseph (Glen Gould) while he serves a stint in prison. Joseph’s return signals an abrupt end to Aila’s reign as the reserve’s narcotics queen, and it also piques the interest of Popper (Mark Antony Krupa), a corrupt and sadistic Indian agent. The bloody tragedy that unfolds becomes an angry and poetic howl for lost lives, lost opportunities, and lost loved ones ― a fever dream whose terrifying fictions are grounded in even more terrible fact."

Set against the backdrop of a glamorous fashion world, the titular high heels serve as a recurring motif, symbolizing women’s paradoxical empowerment and oppression, while Flamenco music and dance reinforces the film with a cultural richness and underscores the film's central themes of identity, love, and loss."

Before she can follow through, she is interrupted by a series of distractions — including a yuppie couple looking to rent her penthouse apartment (Antonio Banderas and Rossy de Palma), the police, a mambo-obsessed taxi driver, a feminist lawyer, and Shiite terrorists — that set her on a path from death-wishing vulnerability to strong, self-assured independence. A pivotal film in Almodóvar’s career,   was the director’s first true international hit, his first film to be nominated for an Academy Award, and — thanks to a scaling-back of the shock value his previous works had enthusiastically traded in — the film that began his transition from fringe-y provocateur to acclaimed art-house auteur. “A perfectly realized work by a man of demonic wit and tender sensibility” ( )."

He’s blissfully unaware of his wife Donna’s affair, but that will be the least of his worries when his family goes missing: the closet monsters have burst free by way of a gigantic rabid St. Bernard, who feasts on flesh and fear and terrorizes his helpless wife and child. As one of Stephen King’s most suspenseful and scary adaptations, absent of his trademark supernatural underpinnings, 1983’s   remains a canon creature feature of man’s best friend turning beastly.

Following news of an old acquaintance’s death, blind novelist “Harry Caine” (Lluís Homar) reluctantly relates to his young companion the tale of how he lost his eyesight. Sixteen years earlier, “Harry” was Mateo Blanco, a respected film director who was being pressured to cast his millionaire producer’s mistress, Lena (Cruz), in his new comedy (a film that looks very much like Almodóvar’s  ). Lena and Blanco soon embark on a passionate affair, leading inevitably to violence, heartbreak, and tragedy. “  is a voluptuary of a film, drunk on primary colors, caressing Penélope Cruz, using the devices of a Hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath” (Roger Ebert)."

Holding Marina hostage in her own home, Ricky assures her that one day she will fall for him — and, in time, she does just that. While   was a big critical and commercial hit in Spain, its North American release immediately changed Almodóvar’s image as a maker of zany comedies, drawing criticism from women’s advocacy groups and earning an X rating for its sexual content. Despite the film’s controversial content and reception, the film was a solid box-office success in the States, and brought its leading man Banderas to the attention of Hollywood."

When her teenage son Esteban is killed in a car crash, grieving middle-aged nurse Manuela (Cecilia Roth) heads to Barcelona in search of the boy’s father, whom Esteban had never met. While searching the city for her former lover, Manuela reluctantly becomes the hub of a makeshift matriarchal community that includes a pregnant nun (Penélope Cruz), a trans hustler (Antonia San Juan), and the glamorous actress (Marisa Paredes) her son idolized.

Young carpenter François and his blonde seamstress wife Thérèse (Jean-Claude and Claire Drouot) move through life with their two small children in a state of perpetual bliss. After beginning an affair with another blonde woman, François decides to share the good news with Thérèse, asserting that “there is more than enough happiness to go around” — she, however, sees matters somewhat differently. Sidestepping sentimentality in its candid and sensual exploration of contemporary mores,   has been variously interpreted as a poetic rumination on non-monogamy, a scathing indictment of male sexual entitlement, and a sexist male fantasy; Varda perhaps explained her intentions best when she said of the film, “Happiness is a beautiful fruit that tastes of cruelty.”"

Chronicling the existential odyssey of a filmmaker confronting the autumn of his life, the Spanish auteur’s 21st feature immerses us in the thrall of memory while celebrating art as a balm for the burdens of mortality. Afflicted with creative stagnancy and a cluster of physical ailments, Salvador (Antonio Banderas) finds himself drifting into uncharted waters when a revival screening of his controversial classic Sabor reunites him with that film’s star, Alberto (Asier Etxeandia). A longtime drug user, Alberto lures Salvador into seeking solace in opiates, and also reminds him of a script that Salvador wrote and abandoned long ago. Along with this forgotten text comes a flood of old acquaintances and vivid memories, some involving Salvador’s beloved mother (Penélope Cruz), others to do with an old flame ravaged by addiction. Infused with dazzling colour and emotional dynamism,   marks another inspired collaboration between Almodóvar and his core creative team of cinematographer José Luis Alcaine, production designer Antxón Gómez, and composer Alberto Iglesias. It’s the cast, however, who render this memoir-fiction hybrid so achingly resonant. Cruz imbues her role with her trademark vivacity, while Banderas has never been more charismatic and moving in a role at once grounded in authentic experience and elevated by flights of wild imagination."
